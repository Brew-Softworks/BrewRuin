An open-sourced discord server nuking utility- cause i'm tired of skids

**THE ACTUAL PYTHON FROM https://python.org IS REQUIRED.**

## Features

## How to use?
Once the bot is in the server, try to put it's role as high as you can, then type `;nuke` - or whatever your prefix is in any channel.

You can change some features in the source-code if you'd like, fork the project & improve on it. bye-bye
